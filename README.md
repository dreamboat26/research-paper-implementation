## **Lumiere: Space-Time Diffusion Model for Video Generation**

### **Overview:**
**Lumiere** introduces a space-time diffusion model for generating videos. It focuses on both **spatial** and **temporal consistency** to produce high-quality, realistic videos over longer sequences.

### **Key Features:**
- **Space-Time Diffusion**: Gradual noise removal process applied in both spatial (image) and temporal (video) domains.
- **High-Quality Video Generation**: Ensures the video looks realistic both in each frame and across frames.
  
### **Architecture:**
1. **Diffusion Process**:
   - Adds noise to a video and then progressively removes the noise over time, refining the output frame by frame.
   - Works on both **spatial features** (within each frame) and **temporal relationships** (between frames).

2. **Space-Time Attention**:
   - The model uses attention mechanisms to understand spatial relationships in frames and temporal dependencies across frames, making the video more coherent.

3. **Video Refinement**:
   - Multiple refinement steps enhance the quality of the generated video by focusing on both spatial details (textures, shapes) and temporal consistency (smooth transitions between frames).

### **Key Contributions:**
- **Space-time diffusion** for generating consistent and high-quality video sequences.
- Focuses on both **spatial resolution** and **temporal coherence** for realistic video generation.

## Conclusion
- **Lumiere** generates **high-quality videos** using a space-time diffusion process to maintain both spatial and temporal consistency.
