## [DoRA: Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation](#dora-weight-decomposed-low-rank-adaptation)
### Overview:
**DoRA** introduces **low-rank adaptation** to efficiently fine-tune large pre-trained models for new tasks. Instead of adjusting all model parameters, it decomposes weight matrices into low-rank components, reducing the computational cost and memory usage.

### Key Contributions:
- **Weight Decomposition**: The model decomposes weight matrices into **low-rank components**, enabling efficient updates during fine-tuning.
- **Low-Rank Adaptation**: Adapts pre-trained models using low-rank updates, preserving most of the modelâ€™s pre-trained knowledge.
- **Efficient Adaptation**: This method is more **resource-efficient** than traditional fine-tuning.

### Architecture:
- **Low-Rank Matrix Decomposition**: Weight matrices in the pre-trained model are broken down into smaller, low-rank components. Only these components are updated during fine-tuning.
- **Task-Specific Adaptation**: Focuses on adapting the model to specific tasks while keeping the rest of the parameters fixed.

### Applications:
- **Transfer Learning**: Efficiently adapting pre-trained models to new tasks.
- **Resource-Constrained Environments**: Useful for adapting large models on devices with limited memory or processing power.
- **Few-Shot Learning**: Fine-tuning with minimal data for specific tasks.
