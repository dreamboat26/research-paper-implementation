## Extending Context Window of Large Language Models via Positional Interpolation

### Problem:
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 have fixed context windows (e.g., 2048 tokens), limiting their ability to process longer sequences.
- Extending the context window increases memory and computation costs exponentially.

### Solution:
- **Positional Interpolation** extends the context window of transformers by smoothly interpolating between positional embeddings.
- Instead of increasing the window size directly, the model uses **linear interpolation** between position embeddings for tokens beyond the fixed window.

### Architecture:
- **Positional Encoding Interpolation**: Interpolates between positional encodings when the input sequence exceeds the original window size, allowing the model to attend to tokens beyond its usual context window.
- **Smooth Interpolation**: Uses linear or other interpolation methods to generate position encodings for tokens outside the fixed window, extending the modelâ€™s receptive field.

### Key Contribution:
- Efficient extension of the context window without increasing memory requirements, making the transformer architecture more scalable and suitable for long-range sequence processing.
