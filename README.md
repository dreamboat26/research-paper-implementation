# Summary of Paper

## **High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression**

### Problem:
- **Audio Compression Challenges**: Traditional audio compression methods, like MP3 and AAC, prioritize file size reduction while compromising on audio fidelity. With neural networks, there are opportunities for better compression quality, but these models often struggle to strike a balance between compression efficiency and sound quality.

### Solution:
- **High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression**: This paper introduces a neural network-based approach to audio compression that focuses on achieving **high fidelity** at low bitrates, using **deep learning models** to learn the most important features in the audio signal for efficient compression.

### Architecture:
- **Neural Audio Codec**: The model uses a neural network to **encode** and **decode** audio signals in a way that retains high audio quality, even at lower bitrates. It learns from a dataset of high-quality audio and applies this learned representation to compress new audio samples.
- **Compression Strategy**: The model uses an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder maps the audio signal to a compressed latent space. The decoder reconstructs the audio from this latent representation, ensuring minimal loss of quality.
- **High-Fidelity Reconstruction**: The key innovation is that, unlike traditional codecs that focus on reducing file size and may distort the audio, this neural codec can achieve **lossless or near-lossless compression**, preserving the original fidelity of the audio while still achieving significant compression.

### Key Contribution:
- **Efficient and High-Quality Compression**: This approach enables **high-quality compression** at lower bitrates than traditional codecs, making it useful for applications like **streaming** and **storage** where audio fidelity is important but bandwidth or disk space is limited.
