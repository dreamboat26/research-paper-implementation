## Unsupervised Discovery of Latent Directions in Diffusion Models

### Overview
This paper focuses on discovering **latent directions** within **Diffusion Models (DMs)** without supervision. These latent directions are interpretable factors in the model's latent space, corresponding to meaningful variations like color, texture, and lighting in images.

### Key Contributions
- **Latent Directions Discovery**:
  - The paper introduces a method to identify interpretable latent directions in the learned latent space of diffusion models.
  - These directions control aspects like the color palette or shape of objects in generated images without requiring labeled data.

- **Improved Control Over Generations**:
  - The discovered latent directions allow users to fine-tune or control specific features in generated outputs, such as changing the style of an image or adjusting lighting conditions.

### Architecture
- **Diffusion Model**:
  - The model begins with a noisy input and iteratively refines it into a clear image. This iterative denoising process is the core of DMs.
  
- **Latent Space Exploration**:
  - The latent space is explored to uncover directions corresponding to specific image features. This process is done without supervision, utilizing unsupervised learning techniques.

### Key Implementation Details
- **Direction Discovery**: The method uses unsupervised techniques to extract meaningful directions in the latent space of the diffusion model, such as style changes, object transformations, etc.
- **Control Mechanism**: Once latent directions are identified, users can manipulate them to modify the generated outputs.
