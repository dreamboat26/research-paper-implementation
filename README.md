# Getting Started with PatchTST in HuggingFace

This guide provides an introduction to PatchTST, a transformer-based model for time series forecasting, along with steps to begin using it effectively.

## Overview

PatchTST, introduced in the paper "A Time Series is Worth 64 Words: Long-term Forecasting with Transformers" by Yuqi Nie et al., presented at ICLR 2023, offers a novel approach to time series forecasting using transformers.

## Quick Overview of PatchTST

PatchTST operates by vectorizing individual time series into patches and encoding them using a Transformer model. Key components include:
- Segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches.
- Channel-independence, where each channel represents a single univariate time series.
- Modular design enabling support for masked time series pre-training and direct forecasting.

## Forecasting with PatchTST

We'll first demonstrate how to utilize PatchTST for time series forecasting using the Electricity dataset.

## Transfer Learning with PatchTST

Next, we'll showcase the transfer learning capabilities of PatchTST by: 
- Employing a pretrained model for zero-shot forecasting on the electrical transformer (ETTh1) dataset.
- Conducting linear probing and fine-tuning of the pretrained model on the target data.

## Steps to Get Started 
- Install Dependencies: Install the HuggingFace library and PatchTST.
- Prepare Data: Organize your time series data.
- Load and Configure Model: Initialize the PatchTST model and configure it for forecasting.
- Training or Loading Pretrained Model: Train the model on your dataset or load a pretrained model.
- Evaluation and Fine-Tuning: Assess the model's performance and fine-tune if necessary.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you can quickly start using PatchTST for time series forecasting tasks. Experiment with different datasets and model configurations to achieve optimal results for your specific use case.
