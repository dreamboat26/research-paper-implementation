## **RoboCat: A Self-Improving Generalist Agent for Robotic Manipulation**

### **Overview**
RoboCat is a **self-improving generalist agent** for robotic manipulation, able to perform tasks such as picking up and arranging objects. It uses **reinforcement learning (RL)** to learn through interaction with the environment, improving autonomously over time.

### **Key Contributions**
- **Self-Improvement Through RL**: RoboCat is trained using reinforcement learning, where it improves through **trial and error** based on feedback from its environment.
- **Generalist Tasks**: Unlike task-specific models, RoboCat generalizes across different tasks like grasping, stacking, or moving objects without requiring separate training for each one.

### **Architecture**
- **Reinforcement Learning**: RoboCat interacts with the environment and learns tasks by receiving rewards or penalties based on the outcome of its actions.
- **Task Generalization**: RoboCat can transfer knowledge from one task to another, allowing it to handle multiple manipulation tasks without retraining for each one.

### **Advantages**
- **Self-Improvement**: It improves over time by interacting with the environment, eliminating the need for supervised learning or manual intervention.
- **Generalization**: RoboCat can perform a variety of tasks without requiring task-specific training.
