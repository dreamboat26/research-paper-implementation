## Exphormer: Sparse Transformers for Graphs

### Problem:
- Traditional transformers struggle with large graphs due to quadratic memory and computation costs.
- Graphs have sparse connectivity, making dense transformers inefficient for graph-based tasks.

### Solution:
- Exphormer introduces a **sparse transformer** model tailored for graph data, combining sparse attention with graph-specific models.
- Exphormer uses **graph-aware sparse attention**, where attention is restricted to neighboring nodes, improving efficiency by reducing the computational complexity.

### Architecture:
- **Sparse Attention**: Instead of full attention, Exphormer focuses on local neighbors, reducing complexity from \(O(N^2)\) to \(O(Nk)\), where \(k\) is the average degree of nodes.
- **Edge-Level Attention**: Focuses on important graph edges, optimizing memory and computational requirements.
- **Graph-Specific Attention Patterns**: The model uses the graph's structure to optimize attention.

### Key Contribution:
- Efficient processing of graph data using sparse attention mechanisms, making transformers scalable to large graphs without incurring heavy computational costs.
