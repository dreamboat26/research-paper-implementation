# Align Your Latents: High-Resolution Video Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models

This repository provides an overview of the architecture proposed in the paper **"Align Your Latents: High-Resolution Video Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models"**.

## Overview
The paper extends **Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)** to enable high-resolution video synthesis by introducing temporal layers while leveraging pre-trained image diffusion models.

## Key Architectural Components

### 1. **Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs)**
- Pre-trained on images to generate high-quality outputs in a **compressed latent space**.
- Reduces computational and memory requirements for high-resolution synthesis.
- Uses a **regularized autoencoder**:
  - **Encoder:** Compresses input images into latent representations.
  - **Decoder:** Reconstructs high-fidelity images from latent representations.

### 2. **Temporal Layers**
- **Purpose:** Introduced to adapt the image-based LDM into a video generator.
- **Architecture:**
  - **3D Convolutions:**
    - Residual blocks for temporal alignment.
    - Captures temporal consistency across frames.
  - **Temporal Attention:**
    - Mechanism to learn dependencies across frames.
  - **Integration:** Temporal layers are interleaved with the spatial CNN layers.
  - **Training:**
    - Spatial layers (from the image LDM) are **frozen**.
    - Temporal layers are trained exclusively on video data.

### 3. **Key Frame Generation and Interpolation**
- Videos are generated by producing **key frames** first.
- **Interpolation models** are used to fill intermediate frames and achieve high frame rates.

### 4. **Super-Resolution and Upsampling**
- Upsampling layers are added to increase spatial resolution:
  - Latent-space super-resolution for 4x scaling.
  - Pixel-space super-resolution to reach megapixel resolutions (e.g., 1280Ã—2048).
- Fine-tuned to maintain **temporal consistency**.

## Training and Inference

### Training
- **Pre-trained Image LDM:**
  - Large-scale image datasets are used to pre-train the spatial layers.
- **Temporal Fine-Tuning:**
  - Temporal layers are trained on video datasets for temporal alignment.
  - Temporal autoencoder fine-tuning ensures consistent reconstruction across frames.

### Inference
- For generating long videos, the temporal alignment layers predict subsequent frames iteratively.
- High-resolution outputs are achieved with super-resolution models.
- **Conditioning:**
  - Supports text prompts, scene labels, or custom initialization for personalized video generation.

## CNNs and 3D Convolutions

### CNNs
- Used in spatial layers for high-quality image synthesis.
- Encoder and decoder in the autoencoder leverage CNNs for latent-space compression and reconstruction.

### 3D Convolutions
- Operate over time and space to ensure temporal consistency across frames.
- Residual blocks are utilized in temporal layers.
