## **RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding**

### **Overview**
RoFormer introduces an **enhanced Transformer architecture** that improves upon traditional position embeddings by using **rotary position embeddings** to more effectively capture token position information.

### **Key Contributions**
- **Rotary Position Embeddings**: Unlike traditional Transformers that use **absolute position embeddings**, RoFormer uses **rotary position embeddings** to capture positional information in a more **efficient and scalable manner**.
- **Improved Contextual Understanding**: This enhancement allows the model to better capture **long-range dependencies** by representing token positions with rotational symmetry.

### **Architecture**
- **Rotary Position Embedding**: This method represents positional information in a continuous, rotational manner, which improves the model’s ability to handle long-range relationships between tokens.

### **Advantages**
- **Scalability**: The rotary position embeddings allow the model to handle longer sequences with greater efficiency compared to traditional position embeddings.
- **Improved Performance**: The new embedding technique improves the model’s ability to understand long-context dependencies.
