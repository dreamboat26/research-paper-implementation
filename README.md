# Summary of Paper

## From Sparse to Soft Mixtures of Experts

### Problem:
- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** models aim to increase efficiency by activating only a subset of model experts per input, but traditional hard gating can result in inefficient expert use and load imbalances.
  
### Solution:
- **Soft Mixture of Experts** replaces hard gating with a **soft-weighting mechanism** where each input token can leverage multiple experts at varying weights.
- This enables better utilization of all available experts, improving load balancing and reducing computation bottlenecks in MoE models.

### Architecture:
- **Soft Expert Selection**: Instead of selecting a fixed subset of experts, the model generates **soft weights** for all experts, combining their outputs based on these weights.
- **Dynamic Gating**: Soft weights for experts are generated dynamically based on the input, allowing the model to better allocate resources across experts.
- **Improved Load Balancing**: By using soft expert weighting, the model avoids issues of under- or over-utilization of specific experts.

### Key Contribution:
- Soft MoE improves MoE models by using a soft-weighted mechanism to dynamically select experts, leading to more efficient use of model resources and better scalability.
