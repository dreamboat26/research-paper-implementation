## [DiTs: Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers](#dits-scalable-diffusion-models-with-transformers)
### Overview:
**DiTs** explores combining **diffusion models** with **transformers** to improve scalability and efficiency in generative tasks like image generation. It addresses the computational complexity of traditional diffusion models while maintaining high-quality outputs.

### Key Contributions:
- **Diffusion Models with Transformers**: Combines transformers with diffusion models, improving **global dependencies** and sample generation quality.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: The transformer-based approach makes the diffusion process more **computationally efficient** and **scalable** to high-resolution data.
- **Improved Image Generation**: The architecture generates **higher-quality samples** compared to CNN-based diffusion models.

### Architecture:
- **Diffusion Process**: Iteratively refines noisy data into a clean sample, with transformers used to improve each refinement step.
- **Attention Mechanism**: The transformerâ€™s attention allows for better capture of **long-range dependencies**, essential for high-quality image generation.
- **Scalable Model Design**: The model is designed for **high-resolution outputs** while being memory-efficient.

### Applications:
- **Image Generation**: High-resolution and realistic image generation.
- **Text-to-Image**: Generating images based on textual descriptions.
- **Super-Resolution**: Enhancing low-resolution images.
- **Video Generation**: Applying diffusion models to video synthesis.
