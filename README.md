# Summary of Paper

## GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection

### Problem:
- Training large language models (LLMs) requires massive memory to store gradients, limiting the scalability of these models.
- Storing gradients for billions of parameters can be prohibitively expensive.

### Solution:
- **GaLore** introduces a technique called **Gradient Low-Rank Projection** to reduce the memory required for storing gradients during training.
- By approximating the gradient matrix using low-rank projections, GaLore reduces the memory footprint without sacrificing model accuracy.

### Architecture:
- **Low-Rank Gradient Approximation**: Instead of storing the full gradient matrix, GaLore uses low-rank projections to reduce the memory usage during backpropagation.
- **Gradient Projection**: Projects the gradients onto a lower-dimensional subspace, which is learned during training, to capture essential information needed for weight updates.
- **Seamless Integration**: This low-rank projection can be integrated into existing transformer architectures without significant changes.

### Key Contribution:
- GaLore significantly reduces the memory consumption required during LLM training by using gradient low-rank projections, enabling the scaling of large models with fewer memory resources.
