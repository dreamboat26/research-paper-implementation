## [CoPE: Contextual Position Encodings](#cope-contextual-position-encodings)
### Overview:
The paper introduces **Contextual Position Encodings (CoPE)**, a method to improve how transformers handle positional information in sequence models. Traditional transformers rely on **absolute positional encodings**, which fail to capture contextual dependencies. CoPE improves this by learning **context-dependent positional encodings** that dynamically adapt based on the sequence input.

### Key Contributions:
- **Contextual Positional Encoding**: Replaces absolute positional encodings with **context-dependent** ones. These are learned dynamically, capturing complex token relationships.
- **Improved Sequence Understanding**: Enables the model to capture richer interactions between tokens, improving tasks like NLP, time-series, and vision.
- **Enhanced Performance**: CoPE outperforms traditional encodings in tasks like machine translation and text generation.

### Architecture:
- **Context-Aware Encoding Layer**: Captures relative positional relationships based on token proximity.
- **Relative Encoding**: Produces dynamic positional encodings for tokens relative to each other instead of using static encodings.

### Applications:
- **NLP**: Improved machine translation, text generation, and summarization.
- **Time-Series Data**: Better modeling of temporal dependencies.
- **Vision Transformers**: Enhances patch relationships for image classification.
