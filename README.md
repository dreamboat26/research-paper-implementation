## 3. **CODEFUSION: A Pre-trained Diffusion Model for Code Generation**

This paper introduces CODEFUSION, a diffusion-based model designed for code generation. CODEFUSION learns to generate high-quality code from natural language descriptions by leveraging a pre-trained diffusion model.

### Key Contributions:
- **Pre-trained Diffusion Model for Code**: CODEFUSION is pre-trained on large code corpora across multiple programming languages to learn the syntax, structure, and semantics of programming languages.
- **Text-to-Code Generation**: The model takes natural language descriptions as input and generates code that fulfills the described task, using a denoising diffusion process.
- **Cross-language Generalization**: The model can generate code in multiple programming languages (Python, Java, etc.), making it versatile for different software development tasks.

### Architecture:
- **Diffusion Process for Code**: The model applies the standard diffusion process (adding noise to data and then denoising) but tailored for code. Each step in the denoising process involves reconstructing masked code tokens based on their surrounding context.
- **Transformer-based Model**: A transformer architecture is used to model relationships between code tokens and to condition the generation on the provided natural language descriptions.

### Use Cases:
- Code generation from natural language
- Code completion and bug fixing
- Code summarization and documentation generation
- Software development automation
