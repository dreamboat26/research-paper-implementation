# GROKKING AT THE EDGE OF NUMERICAL STABILITY

This document summarizes the key concepts, contributions, and findings from the paper **"GROKKING AT THE EDGE OF NUMERICAL STABILITY"**. The paper investigates issues of **numerical instability** in machine learning, particularly deep learning models, and introduces novel methods to improve stability while maintaining model performance.

## 1. **Introduction**

The paper addresses the issue of **numerical instability** that can occur during the training of machine learning models, particularly in deep neural networks. Numerical instability can lead to exploding/vanishing gradients, ineffective optimization, or poor model performance. The authors propose new insights into this issue and methods to mitigate these problems, allowing models to "grok" (achieve deep understanding) while remaining stable.

### Key Goals:
- To identify the sources of numerical instability in deep learning.
- To provide strategies for improving stability without compromising model effectiveness.
- To demonstrate that numerical stability and high performance can coexist even at the edge of unstable regions.

## 2. **Key Concepts**

### 2.1 Numerical Stability in Machine Learning
- **Numerical instability** occurs when small computational errors accumulate over time, resulting in large inaccuracies, leading to gradient explosion, vanishing gradients, or convergence failure.
- In deep learning, this is particularly problematic during training as it can result in models not learning effectively or diverging entirely.

### 2.2 Grokking
- **Grokking** refers to a phenomenon where a model not only fits the data but also deeply understands the underlying patterns. The paper explores how this concept relates to achieving both performance and stability in model training.

### 2.3 Edge of Stability
- The **edge of stability** refers to the delicate boundary between stable training (where gradients are well-behaved and the model converges) and instability (where gradients explode or vanish).
- The paper explores how models can train effectively near this boundary without causing instability.

## 3. **Sources of Numerical Instability**

### 3.1 Exploding and Vanishing Gradients
- **Exploding gradients** occur when gradients during backpropagation grow exponentially, causing the model weights to grow uncontrollably.
- **Vanishing gradients** occur when gradients become too small, effectively stopping the model from learning.

### 3.2 Ill-Conditioned Optimization Problems
- Certain optimization problems are **ill-conditioned**, meaning that small changes in input can cause disproportionately large changes in output. This makes the optimization process sensitive to small numerical errors, which can propagate and lead to instability.

### 3.3 Nonlinearity and Depth
- As neural networks become deeper, the accumulation of numerical errors through layers can worsen, leading to more significant instability.

## 4. **Methods for Addressing Numerical Instability**

### 4.1 Gradient Clipping
- **Gradient clipping** is a technique to prevent exploding gradients by limiting the magnitude of gradients during backpropagation. This ensures that the gradients remain within a stable range, preventing model divergence.
- **How it works**: Gradients are clipped (scaled down) when their norm exceeds a predefined threshold.

### 4.2 Adaptive Learning Rates
- Using **adaptive learning rates** (e.g., Adam, Adagrad) allows the optimizer to adjust learning rates during training, helping to prevent numerical instability when learning rates are too high.
- These methods adapt the learning rate based on recent gradient information, ensuring smoother convergence.

### 4.3 Regularization Techniques
- **Regularization** methods like **L2 regularization** and **dropout** help control overfitting, which in turn can improve numerical stability by reducing the variance in model parameters.

### 4.4 Batch Normalization
- **Batch normalization** helps stabilize the learning process by normalizing activations within each mini-batch, reducing the impact of gradient explosion or vanishing gradients.

### 4.5 Stable Initialization
- **Proper weight initialization** is crucial to prevent gradients from exploding or vanishing at the beginning of training. Methods like **Xavier** or **He initialization** are designed to keep the variance of the gradients in check as training progresses.

### 4.6 Enhanced Loss Function Design
- The authors discuss designing **loss functions** that are less sensitive to numerical instability, by ensuring they don't amplify small errors in gradients. Loss functions that have better conditioning can lead to more stable training.

## 5. **Theoretical Insights**

### 5.1 Understanding the Edge of Stability
- The paper introduces a **mathematical framework** that characterizes the edge of stability in training. This framework allows for a deeper understanding of how small numerical errors can accumulate and affect the optimization process.
- The model's stability is framed as a **trade-off** between accuracy and robustness: the closer you get to the edge of instability, the better the model may fit the data, but at the risk of unstable behavior.

### 5.2 Stability vs. Performance
- The authors propose that it is possible to **grok** (achieve high performance) while staying near the edge of instability. By employing stability-enhancing techniques like adaptive learning rates, gradient clipping, and regularization, it is possible to strike a balance between **performance** (e.g., generalization) and **numerical stability**.

## 6. **Empirical Results**

### 6.1 Experiments with Gradient Clipping
- The authors present experiments where they apply gradient clipping to a variety of neural networks and demonstrate how it prevents instability while allowing the models to train effectively.
- Results show that **clipping gradients at an optimal threshold** prevents the model from diverging, improving convergence and accuracy.

### 6.2 Effects of Adaptive Learning Rates
- The experiments show that **adaptive learning rates** help mitigate the effects of numerical instability. Adaptive optimizers such as Adam show better performance in training stability compared to traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
  
### 6.3 Regularization and Normalization
- **Regularization and batch normalization** consistently help maintain model stability, even with deeper networks, preventing issues of exploding or vanishing gradients during training.

### 6.4 Grokking Performance at the Edge
- The paper demonstrates that models can achieve **"grokking" performance** while staying on the edge of instability by fine-tuning hyperparameters and optimization methods.
