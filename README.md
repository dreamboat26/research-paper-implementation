## Voicebox: Text-Guided Multilingual Universal Speech Generation at Scale

### Overview
**Voicebox** is a state-of-the-art speech generation model capable of generating **multilingual** speech from **text** with high-quality output. It can synthesize speech in various languages, accents, and even adjust the tone or emotional context.

### Key Contributions
- **Multilingual Speech Generation**:
  - Voicebox can generate **speech in multiple languages** from a single model, supporting various linguistic features like accent, tone, and rhythm.

- **Universal Speech Synthesis**:
  - It goes beyond basic text-to-speech (TTS) by providing the ability to produce speech with emotional nuances, changing tone and pitch based on the input context.
  
- **Scalability**:
  - The model can scale to handle large volumes of speech generation tasks, making it suitable for real-time applications like virtual assistants, audiobook generation, and content creation.

### Architecture
- **Multilingual Encoder-Decoder**:
  - The architecture is based on an **encoder-decoder** model, where the encoder processes the input text, and the decoder generates the corresponding speech waveform.
  
- **Conditioning on Emotional Context**:
  - Voicebox uses conditioning to adjust the speech based on emotional tone, accent, or other relevant features of the input text.

### Key Implementation Details
- **Pretraining on Multilingual Corpus**: The model is pretrained on a large multilingual dataset, which helps it generate speech in various languages and accents.
- **Text-to-Speech and Emotion Control**: Voicebox incorporates mechanisms that adjust the tone and emotional context of the speech, allowing for **context-aware speech generation**.
